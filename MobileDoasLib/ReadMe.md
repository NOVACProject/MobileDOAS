The MobileDOASLib is a library of standard C++ code used by MobileDOAS.
    The purpose is to separate out all the code which is pure C++ in a (statically linked) library
    such that the code here can be tested and enable a migration away from the currently strong entanglement
    with MFC and Windows.
